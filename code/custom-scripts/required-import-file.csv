A fragrance that goes beyond and challenges 
the limits of power and seduction. To last. A fragrance which is a concentrate of intensity and a true sublimation of the original fragrance.

Design- The perfume is enrobed in a black bottle. As black as night, as black as the intensity of a superb encounter. The infinitely masculine elegance of the gradated, lacquered glass reveals the perfume. Luxurious and contemporary. The Mercedes-Benz emblem, the famous three-pointed star, is engraved in relief in the bottom of the bottle. And like a seal on its elegant bonnet. The bottle nestles in a deep, matte, darkly luminous pack stamped with the silver star.
